
# The Expense Tracker
The Expense Tracker App is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users track their expenses efficiently. It allows users to record, categorize, and analyze their expenses, providing a clear overview of their financial activities.


## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Rotating the application
- Graphical representation
- Cross platform(obvoiusly bros:Flutter it is!)


## Roadmap

- That's not it surely, there is something I want to do new with it.So I am planning for a few features.
- Taking input of salary or total amount user wants to spend.
- Making a pie chart in the home screen which shows every expenditure and saving.
- Making each icon tappable and then showing expenditure in each category.
